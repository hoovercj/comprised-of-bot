# 'Comprised Of' Bot

A simple twitter bot that monitors the twitter streaming API for users tweeting the phrase 'comprised of'. It then replies with a helpful suggestion to used 'composed of' instead and links to the great essay on the topic by profilic Wikipedia Editor GiraffeData.

You can read the essay here as well as a great profile written about him and posted on Medium.

The bot is written in node.js with a redis brain makes sure that users aren't 'educated' twice by receiving more than one reply from the account. The project is hosted on heroku and was built entirely in the Cloud9 IDE.
